## ℹ️ About Essay Grader for Mac

Essay Grader for Mac was developed to simplify and modernize the way educators evaluate student writing. Instead of spending hours marking papers with handwritten comments, teachers can now use a structured digital interface to provide feedback faster, more accurately, and with greater consistency.  

The app comes with **built-in grading rubrics** that can be customized to match specific educational goals. Categories such as thesis clarity, argument strength, grammar, vocabulary, organization, and originality can all be scored within the application. Educators can quickly assign points, write comments, and deliver detailed assessments that help students grow as writers.  

One of the strongest benefits of Essay Grader is its **time-saving workflow**. Educators no longer need to manually rewrite the same feedback for recurring issues. Instead, they can store frequently used comments in the app and apply them to multiple essays. This not only reduces grading time but also ensures fairness and consistency across all students.  

The software also supports **progress tracking and reporting**, allowing educators to generate summaries of student performance over time. These insights help identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas needing further instruction. Teachers can export reports for personal records, parent meetings, or institutional documentation.  

Beyond grading efficiency, Essay Grader fosters **better communication between teachers and students**. Feedback is delivered in a professional, readable format, making it easier for students to understand their mistakes and learn from them. By transforming grading into a clear, structured process, the app enhances both teaching effectiveness and student learning outcomes.  

Finally, Essay Grader for Mac is **fully optimized for macOS**, ensuring smooth performance on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs. Its clean, academic-focused interface makes it accessible to new users, while advanced customization options provide power for experienced educators. Whether you teach in high school, university, or professional training programs, Essay Grader helps bring efficiency, fairness, and clarity to the essay evaluation process.
